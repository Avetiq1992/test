                        <h3>Armenian Culture</h3>
                        <p>Armenian religion, family life, and the rituals and traditions expressed in their culture
                            have played a powerful role in helping Armenians around the world hold on to a strong sense
                            of identity and heritage.</p>
                        <h3>Christianity</h3>
                        <p>Armenia proudly claims the distinction of being the first country to adopt Christianity as a
                            state religion. Tradition has it that two of Jesus`s Apostles, Thaddeus and Bartholomew,
                            successfully preached Christianity to Armenians as early as AD 40. In 301, Christianity was
                            declared the official religion, and a church was built at Etchmiadzin, which today is a
                            UNESCO World Heritage site. Armenians are proud that their homeland is the location of Mount
                            Ararat, which may have been the resting place of Noah`s ark after the flood, and other
                            Biblical events.
                            <br> As the unique Armenian alphabet developed in the 5th century, so did a flowering of
                            Christian religious literature. Armenian religious scholars made important contributions to
                            the wider Christian world. Translations of key scriptural texts by early Armenian scholars
                            are now some of the earliest versions available.
                            <br> Throughout the past 1,000 years, Armenians who migrated out of the country have taken
                            their
                            faith with them. When the Kingdom of Armenia fell in 1375, the church not only survived, but
                            it assumed a leadership role that helped keep Armenian identity alive. Today, the Armenian
                            Apostolic Church numbers between 8 and 9 million members. This membership includes about 94
                            percent of the population of the country, more than 3.5 million members in Europe, and more
                            than a million members in the United States.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Family Life</h3>
                        <p>
                            Armenian culture celebrates families and family life. Weddings no longer last for several
                            days, but they are still lively affairs filled with joyous rituals. Extended families of
                            both bride and groom play important roles; a godparent couple serves as witnesses and role
                            models. At church wedding services, a priest crowns the couple to symbolize the creation of
                            their “little kingdom” as a family. Dancing, music, and food follow, and large numbers of
                            friends and family bestow generous gifts.
                            <br>Wedding rituals express hope that the marriage will be blessed with children.
                            Traditional Armenian families welcome many children. The community celebrates birth with
                            music and by decorating the infant`s home with green branches that symbolize the continuity
                            of the family. There is even a formal celebration when a baby`s first tooth appears. This
                            love for children outlasts childhood; extended families may live together or visit each
                            other frequently. The family unit is so important that Armenian names often identify an
                            ancestor or ancestral place, which can help those who are researching their Armenian family
                            history.

                        <h3>Traditional Armenian Arts</h3>
                        <p>
                            Carpet making is an ancient Armenian handicraft that is still practiced today. Traditional
                            rugs have bright colors and decorative motifs such as dragons, stylized geometric shapes,
                            and other ornamentation that can be highly symbolic. Rugs decorate more than the floor in
                            Armenian homes; they may rest on tables, chairs, and beds.
                            <br>Khachkars are an ancient form of Armenian sculpture. Used as tombstones or memorials,
                            these outdoor stone monuments are decorated with crosses, sometimes ornately. Khachkar
                            building peaked in the 12th and 14th centuries. Today, more than 50,000 unique, hand-carved
                            khachkars survive.
                            <br>These aren`t the only important Armenian handicrafts. Armenian jewelers have been
                            creating beautiful jewelry from gold, silver, and precious stones for both men and women for
                            1,000 years. A lot of jewelry carried special symbolism and served as amulets; some could be
                            worn only by women or men of a certain status. For hundreds of years, delicate, intricate
                            embroidery and needle lace has adorned Armenian churches and homes, as well as clothing,
                            carpets, and religious vestments.

                <h2>Armenian architecture</h2>
                <div class="element">
                    <div class="text">
                        <h3>Construction</h3>
                        <p>
                            Armenian architecture, as it originates in an earthquake-prone region, tends to be built
                            with
                            this hazard in mind. Armenian buildings tend to be rather low-slung and thick-walled in
                            design.
                            Armenia has abundant resources of stone, and relatively few forests, so stone was nearly
                            always
                            used throughout for large buildings. Small buildings and most residential buildings were
                            normally constructed of lighter materials, and hardly any early examples survive, as at the
                            abandoned medieval capital of Ani.
                            <br>he stone used in buildings is typically quarried all at the same location, in order to
                            give the structure a uniform color. In cases where different color stone are used, they are
                            often intentionally contrasted in a striped or checkerboard pattern. Powder made out of
                            ground stone of the same type was often applied along the joints of the tuff slabs to give
                            buildings a seamless look. Unlike the Romans or Syrians who were building at the same
                            time, Armenians never used wood or brick when building large structures.

                            Armenian architecture employs a form of concrete to produce sturdy buildings,. It is a
                            mixture of lime mortar, broken tuff, and rocks around which forms a core against which thin
                            slabs of tuff are arranged in brickwork fashion. As the wet mortar mixture dries it forms a
                            strong concrete-like mass sealed together with the tuff around it and, due to tuff's
                            properties, it becomes harder with time. Initially, almost no core was used in the
                            construction of churches, stone blocks were simply sealed together, but as architects saw
                            how those with mortar cores withstood tremors, the size of the core expanded. Frescos of
                            marble or another stone were often affixed to the side of these buildings, usually at a
                            later date.
                        </p>
                        <h3>History of Armenian architecture</h3>
                        <p>
                            During the third millennium B.C, prehistoric Armenian architecture was already distinctive.
                            The most common feature was its groundwork, which incorporated many geometrical shapes,
                            ultimately forming a cell shape. An example of such architecture can be found in Kültəpə,
                            near Nakhchivan. These buildings were approximately 6-7 metres wide and about 5 metres high.

                            Urban architectural traditions, and other forms of art in the years before Christ continued
                            to develop and later were influenced by Greco-Roman art.[5] Urartian architecture is known
                            for its use of intricately cut rocks, used as foundations for mud brick buildings, usually
                            constructed in a compact manner (such as in Erebuni).
                            <br>Urartian temples had massive stone walls at lower levels and a relatively small interior
                            space, usually square, and rose high; they were generally placed at the highest point of a
                            site. Higher levels were in mud brick, which has not survived, and it is not fully clear how
                            appeared. The late Temple of Garni of the 1st century AD, in a fully Hellenistic style, is
                            the only pagan monument left in any sort of complete state in Armenia, as many others were
                            destroyed or converted to Christian places of worship under Tiridates III of Armenia.[6]
                            Garni includes local elements of sacred numerology and geometry. The temple has a column to
                            inter column ratio of 1/3 (1 is the primary number of the universe and 3 is the holiest of
                            all numbers as it represents the Greco-Roman triad Jupiter, Juno and Minerva). Aside from
                            being aesthetically beautiful, Garni's design can be seen as being a reaffirmation of the
                            universal laws that governed man's destiny. The angles, number of columns, and dimensions
                            were created with a careful eye; Armenian pagans wanted to appease the gods and protect
                            humanity from their wrath. This sacred geometry is evident in the entire temple. To the
                            people who created it, it was the perfect embodiment of their communion with the universe.
                            Note that although sacred geometry was mostly used in religious buildings, secular buildings
                            adopted some aspects of it.

                            Christianity's institution as Armenia's official religion in 301 allowed new developments in
                            Armenian architecture, which nevertheless preserved older traditions. In fact it would be
                            almost impossible to find any religion that rose completely on its own without borrowing
                            some traditions from the past. Exploring Armenian churches is critical to our understanding
                            of Medieval Armenia. Beyond that, the Armenian churches describe us the general landscape of
                            the Christian East at a time when eyewitness accounts were exceedingly rare. In their
                            messages of authenticity and legitimacy, the churches shaped and preserved public memory,
                            negotiating among diverse linguistic, religious, political, and ethnic groups.

                            The first Armenian churches were built on the orders of St. Gregory the Illuminator, and
                            were often built on top of pagan temples, and imitated some aspects of Armenian
                            pre-Christian architecture.
                        </p>
                        <h3>The formative period</h3>
                        <p>
                            The first Armenian churches were built between the 4th and 7th century, beginning when
                            Armenia converted to Christianity, and ending with the Arab invasion of Armenia. The early
                            churches were mostly simple basilicas, but some with side apses. By the 5th century the
                            typical cupola cone in the center had become widely used. By the 7th century,
                            centrally-planned churches had been built and a more complicated niched buttress and
                            radiating Hrip'simé style had formed. By the time of the Arab invasion, most of what we now
                            know as classical Armenian architecture had formed.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Bagratid revival</h3>
                        <p>
                            From the 9th to 11th century, Armenian architecture underwent a revival under the patronage
                            of the Bagratid Dynasty with a great deal of building done in the area of Lake Van, this
                            included both traditional styles and new innovations. Ornately carved Armenian khachkars
                            were developed during this time. Many new cities and churches were built during this
                            time, including a new capital at Lake Van and a new Cathedral on Akdamar Island to match.
                            The Cathedral of Ani was also completed during this dynasty. It was during this time that
                            the first major monasteries, such as Haghpat and Haritchavank were built. This period was
                            ended by the Seljuk invasion.

                        </p>
                        <h3>Monasteries flourish</h3>
                        <p>
                            From the 12th to 14th century under the Zakarid dynasty saw an explosion in the number of
                            monasteries built, including Saghmosavank Monastery, the Akhtala monastery, Kaymakl 1
                            Monastery, Kecharis Monastery and Makaravank Monastery. Monasteries were institutes of
                            learning, and much of medieval Armenian literature was written in this time period. The
                            invasion of Timurlane and the destruction of Cilician Armenia ended architectural
                            progression from another 250 years.

                            Soghomon Soghomonian,[A] ordained and commonly known as Komitas,[B] (Armenian: Կոմիտաս; 8
                            October [O.S. 26 September] 1869 – 22 October 1935) was an Armenian priest, musicologist,
                            composer, arranger, singer, and choirmaster, who is considered the founder of the Armenian
                            national school of music.[4][7] He is recognized as one of the pioneers of
                            ethnomusicology.[8][9]

                            Orphaned at a young age, Komitas was taken to Etchmiadzin, Armenia's religious center, where
                            he received education at the Gevorgian Seminary. Following his ordination as vardapet
                            (celibate priest) in 1895, he studied music at the Frederick William University in Berlin.
                            He thereafter "used his Western training to build a national tradition".[10] He collected
                            and transcribed over 3,000 pieces of Armenian folk music, more than half of which were
                            subsequently lost and only around 1,200 are now extant. Besides Armenian folk songs, he also
                            showed interest in other cultures and in 1903 published the first-ever collection of Kurdish
                            folk songs titled Kurdish melodies. His choir presented Armenian music in many European
                            cities, earning the praise of Claude Debussy, among others. Komitas settled in
                            Constantinople in 1910 to escape mistreatment by ultra-conservative clergymen at Etchmiadzin
                            and to introduce Armenian folk music to wider audiences. He was widely embraced by Armenian
                            communities, while Arshag Chobanian called him the "savior of Armenian music".[11]

                            During the Armenian genocide—along with hundreds of other Armenian intellectuals—Komitas was
                            arrested and deported to a prison camp in April 1915 by the Ottoman government. He was soon
                            released under unclear circumstances and, having witnessed indiscriminate cruelty and
                            relentless massacres of the Armenians by the Ottoman Turks, Komitas experienced a mental
                            breakdown and developed a severe case of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The
                            widespread hostile environment in Constantinople and reports of mass-scale Armenian death
                            marches and massacres that reached him further worsened his fragile mental state. He was
                            first placed in a Turkish military-operated hospital until 1919 and then transferred to
                            psychiatric hospitals in Paris, where he spent the last years of his life in agony. Komitas
                            is widely seen as a martyr of the genocide and has been depicted as one of the main symbols
                            of the Armenian Genocide in art.
